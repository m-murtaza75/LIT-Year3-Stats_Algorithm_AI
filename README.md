#### Dijkstra Shortest Path Algorithm

This algorithm is implemented in Java for the directed-graph. Graph data is stored in Stream of arcs file format which is generated by GenerateGraph class. For calculating the shortest path distance, the program is based on these steps:

1.	Set all the nodes to unknown as at the start it is evident that no node is marked as known and pick the one which have minimum weight.
2.	Select one node as root, set its weight to zero and set other’s weight to infinity.
3.	Visit root node’s (minimum weight node) adjacent nodes if there are any.
4.	Update their distances from the source as it will be less than infinity.
5.	Repeat 3rd and 4th steps until all the connected nodes are marked as known.


Note: Program only accepts graph data in stream of arcs file format.
